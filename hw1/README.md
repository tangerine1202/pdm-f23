# How to run the code

## Task 1

You need to assign the image paths in the `bev.py` file.

```bash
python bev.py
```

## Task 2

The arguments are the same as the homework template, except I added a argument to control if the global registration is used. 
This implementation also reports the reconstruction time for convenience.

``` bash
python reconstruct.py
```
